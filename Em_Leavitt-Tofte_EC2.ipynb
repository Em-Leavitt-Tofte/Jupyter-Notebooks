    "**Business Context.** You are an analyst at the ICCT ([International Council on Clean Transportation](https://theicct.org/mission-history)), an NGO that provides research to environmental authorities around the world. You are part of a team that is preparing a report on the alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) market in the United States, with a particular focus on the state of Washington.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your job is to **provide a characterization of the AFV market in the US and in Washington, including data about energy efficiency of the vehicles over time, geographical distribution, etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** You will be working with three Excel files that contain the raw data. The first one is  [`us_sales_fellow.xlsx`](data/us_sales_fellow.xlsx), which contains aggregated sales figures for the US; the second one is [`us_ranges_fellow.xlsx`](data/us_ranges_fellow.xlsx), which has data about ranges of electrical vehicles. These data files come from the US Department of Energy. The last one is [`washington_evs_fellow.xlsx`](data/washington_evs_fellow.xlsx), which is a census of all the electric vehicles in circulation in Washington state. This census data comes from the Washington State Department of Licensing.\n",

    "[Alternative fuel vehicles (AFV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_fuel_vehicle) are vehicles that run either partially or totally on an energy source that is not gasoline or diesel, such as ethanol, solar power, electricity, or hydrogen. Some AFVs are highly efficient and, perhaps more importantly, have reduced greenhouse gas emissions relative to traditional vehicles, which makes them an important part of environmental recovery and protection plans around the globe.\n",

PHEVs and EVs are often counted as a single category, Plug-in electric vehicles (*PEV*s). **Source:** Alternative Fuels Data Center, US Department of Energy."

    "Read this excerpt from [this page](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/flexible_fuel.html) about flexible fuel vehicles:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) have an internal combustion engine and are capable of operating on gasoline and any blend of gasoline and ethanol up to 83%. E85 (or flex fuel) is a gasoline-ethanol blend containing 51% to 83% ethanol, depending on geography and season. According to IHS Markit, as of 2017, there were more than 21 million FFVs in the United States. Because FFVs are factory made and are capable of operating on gasoline and gasoline-ethanol blends, many vehicle owners don't realize their car is an FFV and that they have a choice of fuels to use.\n",

    "If many owners aren't aware that their vehicle is an FFV then they also wouldn't register their vehicle as one. Therefore, there could be more FFV owners than represented in the chart. If this is true than all of the other AFV percentages are also incorrect since they use the sum of all types to calculate each percentage. If it is a drastic difference then a the smaller percentages start to become insignificant incomparison to the largest one. It's would become harder to tell the smaller percentages apart."

    "As time has passed AFV's have become more popular. From the years 2011 to 2017, EV's and PHEV's had similar amounts of units sold. Then in 2018 and 2019 the number of EV's greatly surpasses the number of PHEV's sold. It is possible that PHEV's helped shift consumers from gas to more sustainable sources like electricity. Why get an PHEV when you can go fully electric? The number of EV's sold has consistently risen whereas PHEV units sold has varied. Years 2018 and 2019 of the chart suggest PHEV's will phase out as the popularity of EV's keeps rising."
