    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** You work for a company that specializes in analyzing data for a variety of clients in the sports industry. Some questions that you frequently encounter include determining if a new player is promising enough to invest money in their development, which teams are the most likely to win certain matches, what events will be the most attractive to advertisers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** As part of one of your projects, you have been asked to perform an exploratory data analysis of historical data to **detect patterns in the provenance, physical profile, and other characteristics of the athletes who compete in the Olympic games**. The conclusions of your analysis will help the rest of the team prepare a report for a new client who helps sports gear manufacturers find advertising opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** You have scraped a dataset from the Internet, which contains data for all the Olympic games from Norway 1994 to Rio 2016. It comprises data for 46,533 individual athletes and has 13 columns for each one of them. There are 68,848 rows instead of 46,533 rows in the `olympics_data` worksheet because some athletes have won multiple medals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ID**: A unique number assigned to each athlete\n",
    "* **Name**: The athlete's name\n",
    "* **Sex**: The athlete's sex\n",
    "* **Age**: The athlete's age at the moment of the games\n",
    "* **Height**: The athlete's height in centimeters\n",
    "* **Weight**: The athlete's weight in kilograms\n",
    "* **Team**: The athlete's team (country)\n",
    "* **Year**: The year\n",
    "* **Season**: The season\n",
    "* **City**: The host city\n",
    "* **Sport**: The sport the athlete competed in\n",
    "* **Medal**: The medal that the athlete won, if any (can be Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA)\n",
    "* **Won medal?**: 1 if the athlete won a medal, 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset can be downloaded from [this link](data/olympics_fellow.xlsx).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Please write all your formulas in the `calculations` worksheet unless explicitly asked to do it in another sheet, clearly indicating the exercise they belong to. You will need to submit the Excel file along with this notebook."
